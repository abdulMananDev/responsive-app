we use min-width

        // what ever content we write into the other files will replace this content over here that is it allows us to pass a bleck of code into our mixin
     }
 }
/* there are three ways of doing the media quiries:
(a) directly writing the media quieries in the separate files//do not use that is writing one big media query
(b) including the media query into each of our selector eg in the story; writing media quieries in story file only
problem we have tp repeat the media query in all of our files  so much of work load...not preferable

(c) The best solution_We will write a mixin for the media queries .and where ever  we need then we will include the one for the phone one for the tablet one for the tablet landscape adain and again in ur different files
using the content directory

(d) instead of writing the mixins for the diffreent devices that is the phone the tablet we use the (if) directive and write the code for the different breakpoints

// ems are the best options fot the media quereis
// !IMPORTANT: the ems and rems are not affected by the root font zixe we have defined above ie 62.5 but depend on the font size coming from the browser that is 1 em =16px    1px=1/16em
// we use em's and nor rem's because rems fail to use in aome of the browsers
